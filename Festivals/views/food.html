                </div>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Food Festivals throughout the world are often based on the traditional farming techniques, seasons Food festivals
                    are related to food culture of an area, whether through the preparation of food served or the time period
                    in which the festival is celebrated. Food festivals are considered strengthening agents for local cultural
                    heritage, and simultaneously celebrate this cultural heritage while also commodifying it for a broader
                    national or international audience. While historically aligned with culturally significant food harvesting
                    periods, contemporary food festivals are usually associated with businesses entities or nonprofit organizations
                    and engage a great deal of marketing for their festivals, since their success is measured off how much
                    revenue they generate for the local community, region, or entity putting on the event. Modern food festivals
                    are also a large part of the food tourism industry, which uses food festivals and regional cuisine to
                    support the broader tourism industry of a particular locality. </p>

                <h2>Food Tourism</h2>
                <p>Food festivals are quickly becoming part of a vast food tourism industry. Food tourism itself has become
                    an important part of the tourism industry worldwide, and the presence of food festivals shown to support
                    local industry development. Food festivals are an important part of destination branding for many regions,
                    creating an event-based reason for individuals to visit otherwise unattractive localities and promote
                    local products and services outside of an urban product environment. Several case studies have shown
                    that food festivals can potentially improve social sustainability while also heavily supporting the tourism
                    and hospitality industries. Food tourism is also an important reason why people attend food festivals
                    around the world. Studies have shown that engagement with food tourism indicates that an individual will
                    attend festivals again in the future, indicating a cooperative element to food tourism and food festival
                    attendance
