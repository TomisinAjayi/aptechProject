            Seasonal festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or thanksgiving.
            They may also provide entertainment, which was particularly important to local communities before the advent
            of mass-produced entertainment. Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also seek to inform community
            members of their traditions; the involvement of elders sharing stories and experience provides a means for unity
            among families. A harvest festival is an annual celebration that occurs around the time of the main harvest of
            a given region. Given the differences in climate and crops around the world, harvest festivals can be found at
            various times at different places. Harvest festivals typically feature feasting, both family and public, with
            foods that are drawn from crops that come to maturity around the time of the festival. Ample food and freedom
            from the necessity to work in the fields are two central features of harvest festivals: eating, merriment, contests,
            music and romance are common features of harvest festivals around the world.
